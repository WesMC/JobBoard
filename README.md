# JobBoard

This project was created as a technical challenge to obtain my first internship at a local start-up called [Awato](https://awato.io "Awato's Demo Web App").

## Setup

To setup the project for viewing, you must have the ability to easily create a functioning NodeJS server. Simply follow the downloading and installing instructions, and from the root project directory, run the command:

<pre>
    $npm install -g http-server
</pre>

This is a node package that let's us spin-up a server on the fly within whatever file path we give it. Once installed run the command
<pre>
    $http-server . -o
</pre>

That will create a simple NodeJS server in our project directory, and then open up your default browser.
